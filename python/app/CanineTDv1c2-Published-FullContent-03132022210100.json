In dogs with PRA, firstly the rods are affected followed by cones. The eyes may have less pigmentation with slight sheen and the affected dog may bump into walls or into unfamiliar objections frequently, may show reluctance to go down the stairs or jump down steps and can develop cataracts,.

Rod photoreceptor cells degenerate first resulting in night blindness, followed by cones resulting in color vision loss.

Clinical signs are often non specific and include  lethargy, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, jaundice, abdominal discomfort or pain, fever, abdominal distension, dehydration, excessive urination, excessive thirst, collapse from septic shock. The affected dogs show increased levels of liver enzymes, and cholesterol.  The diagnosis of this disorder in affected dogs is by ultrasound examination."

The most common symptoms are seizures, tremors, ataxia and dementia. Some affected dogs show subtle behavioural changes such as staring into space, becoming fixated on and staring at objects, pacing, circling, and walking into a wall.

Symptoms include eye pain, appearance of vessels in the white of the eye, redness, cloudy cornea, watery eyes, light avoidance, weak blink response, no response of pupil to light, vision problems resulting in bumping into objects, difficulty finding toys, walking gingerly and bulging of the eye.

Risk to offspring is 50%.  However, some studies also report autosomal recessive inheritance where two copies of VWF gene carry the mutation, one copy inherited from each parent. In such an inheritance, unaffected carrier parents have 25% risk of having a pup with Von Willebrand disease III. Incomplete penetrance is also recorded."
